                            Help me it's like the walls are caving in
                            Sometimes I feel like giving up
                            But I just can't
                            It isn't in my blood
                            Laying on the bathroom floor feeling nothing
                            I'm overwhelmed and insecure give me something
                            I could take to ease my mind slowly
                            Just have a drink and you'll feel better
                            Just take her home and you'll feel better
                            Keep telling me that it gets better
                            Does it ever
                            Help me it's like the walls are caving in
                            Sometimes I feel like giving up
                            No medicine is strong enough
                            Someone help me
                            I'm crawling in my skin
                            Sometimes I feel like giving up
                            But I just can't
                            It isn't in my blood
